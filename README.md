## GOAL
My goal is to become a data scientist or self-driving car engineer so that I can combine my systems control experience and mathematical background with machine learning. To acheive the goal, I need to equip myself with knowledge of machine learning and programming and hence I list some courses that I would like to take in the coming years.
