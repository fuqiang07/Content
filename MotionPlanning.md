# GOAL
My goal is to become a self-driving car engineer so that I can build up my career based on my systems control experience and mathematical background. To realize the goal, I need to equip myself with knowledge of control, motion planning and decision making and hence I list some courses that I would like to take in the coming years.

## Course Lists

### CONTROL
